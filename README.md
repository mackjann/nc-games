# Welcome to NC-GAMES!

This is a board game review site, with the front and built in React and the back-end pulling data from an API built using Express and PSQL. The API is hosted here: https://nc-games-server.herokuapp.com/api/.

The application is CURRENTLY UNFINISHED, but this is something I will come back to after graduating from Northcoders.

The functionality for the site is largely there - users can view Reviews by category, and by clicking on a single review card the user is taken to the review page where they are able to like or dislike the review, post a comment, and like or dislike other comments. Comments currently only appear on page-reload. Comments/likes are attributed to the logged in user, which can be changed using the button on the navbar.

Please note that reviews currently take a few seconds to load when selecting the 'Reviews' tab due to delay from the API.

The Home and About pages are currently blank.

TO run, please enter 'npm start' in the terminal.
